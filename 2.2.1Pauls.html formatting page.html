            <p class="text1">
                Candidates should demonstrate the practical capability of sourcing
                content including using their initiative to find out about and
                exploit the potential of new ICT tools and information sources.
                Evidence: Evidence from web page content.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p class="text1">
                Candidates should give consideration to size and type of video
                and audio files. e.g. it is often better to make a link to a
                video on a site like School Tube designed for delivering video
                than it is to upload the video file to a general purpose site.

            <h3><p class="text2">Evidence from the nature of the content on their web pages.</p></h3>
            <p class="text1">
                We expect graphics to be reasonable size and in .jpg or .png formats.
                A graphic 1200 pixels across will not fit on some screens and a 4 meg
                file is almost certainly capable of being reduced in size for better downloading.
                HTML should not be full of redundant tags - Don't use MS Publisher!
                Attention to detail produces higher quality and we want aspiration to quality.
